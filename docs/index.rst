bettermoments
=============

``bettermoments`` creates moment maps of spectral line data and their
associated uncertainties. The command-line interface makes it as seamless as
possible. The ``quadratic`` method is described in detail in `Teague & Foreman-Mackey
(2018)`_ while the uncertainties associated with more typical moment maps can
be found in `Teague (2019)`_.
