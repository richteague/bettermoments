def collapse_width(velax, data, rms):

    Returns an effective width, a rescaled ratio of the integrated intensity
    and the line peak. For a Gaussian line profile this would be the Doppler
    width as the total intensity is given by,

    .. math::
        M_0 = \sum_{i}^N I_i \, \Delta v_{{\rm chan},\,i}

    where :math:`\Delta v_i` and :math:`I_i` are the chanenl width and flux
    density at the :math:`i^{\rm th}` channel. If the line profile is Gaussian,
    then equally

    .. math::
        M_0 = \sqrt{\pi} \times F_{\nu} \times \Delta V

    where :math:`F_{\nu}` is the peak value of the line and :math:`\Delta V` is
    the Doppler width of the line. As :math:`M_0` and :math:`F_{\nu}` are
    readily calculated using
    :func:`bettermoments.collapse_cube.collapse_zeroth` and
    :func:`bettermoments.collapse_cube.collapse_quadratic`, respectively,
    :math:`\Delta V` can calculated through :math:`\Delta V = M_{0} \, / \,
    (\sqrt{\pi} \, F_{\nu})`. This should be more robust against noise than
    second moment maps.

    Args:
        velax (ndarray): Velocity axis of the cube.
        data (ndarray): Flux densities or brightness temperature array. Assumes
            that the first axis is the velocity axis.
        rms (float): Noise per pixel in same units as ``data``.

    Returns:
        ``dV`` (`ndarray`), ``ddV`` (`ndarray`):
            The effective velocity dispersion, ``dV`` and ``ddV``, the
            associated uncertainty.
